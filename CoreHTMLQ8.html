    <h1>Full Stack Web Development Stacks</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>MERN Stack</b></dt>
        <dd>MERN is one of several variations of the MEAN stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node),
             where the traditional Angular frontend framework is replaced with React JS. The main
              benefit of using MERN is the integration of React and its powerful library and 
              capability to use code simultaneously on servers and browsers. Additionally, it has 
              phenomenal full-stack development (front-end and backend) possibilities. Besides, 
              React utilizes JavaScript XML and Virtual DOM, and these components work and implement
              changes seamlessly.</dd>

        <dt><b>Mean Stack</b></dt>
        <dd>MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic websites and 
            web applications. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs are written in 
            JavaScript. Besides, experts consider MEAN technology the best for web development due to 
            its various benefits. Itâ€™s comprised of MongoDB (a NoSQL DB), Express.js (a backend web framework),
             Angular (a front-end framework), and Node.js (an open-source cross-platform server), and can be
              used for developing complex mobile and responsive web applications.</dd>

        <dt><b>MEVN Stack</b></dt>
        <dd>Other variants of MEAN Stack, the MEVN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), and really any 
            frontend JavaScript framework can work.It is the open-source JavaScript software stack that 
            has emerged as a new and evolving way to build powerful and dynamic web applications. 
            Besides, its software components can be used to effectively design frontend and backend
             development and improve the functionality of your website or app.</dd>

        <dt><b>PERN Stack</b></dt>
        <dd>This stack consists of PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js. Combining these technologies, 
            you can as well build a full-stack web application with CRUD operations.</dd>

        <dt><b>LAMP Stack</b></dt>
        <dd>LAMP is an old classic industry standard when it comes to time-tested web development stacks, 
            which comprises MySQL (Relational Database Management), Linux (Operating System), PHP (Programming 
            Language),and Apache (HTTP server). It is open-source and available for free. The stack runs 
            efficiently on alloperating systems. In web development, it provides the website with the best 
            performance, cost efficiency,and flexibility. Besides, its components can be interchanged or 
            modified within the same stack. LAMP refers now to a generic software stack model and its 
            components are largely interchangeable.</dd>
        
        <dt><b>Flutter Stack</b></dt>
        <dd>The next web development technology on this list is Flutter, a revolutionary web stack for the 
            cross-platform development industry. Its major components include Dart, the Flutter engine,
            Foundation Library, and design-specific widgets.</dd>

        <dt><b>The Serverless Technology Stack</b></dt>
        <dd>Well, Developing applications on cloud infrastructure is a popular web development trend these 
            days, and choosing it can benefit you greatly. Besides, infrastructure management has become easy
             now with the provision of services and tools provided by Serverless computing platforms.</dd>
        
        <dt><b>Ruby On Rails Tech Stack</b></dt>
        <dd>Ruby on Rails (RoR) is a developer-friendly web development stack. It is an open-source, dynamic 
            programming language. Besides, RoR facilitates the development of lightweight applications that 
            increase flexibility.</dd>
